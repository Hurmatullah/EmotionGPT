## Model Fine-Tuning

The base GPT-2 model was fine-tuned using transfer learning techniques. Here are the details:

- **Pre-trained Model**: GPT-2 (OpenAI's pre-trained transformer model).
- **Fine-Tuning Methodology**:
  - Optimized with [specific optimizer].
  - Used [library or framework, e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch].
  - Training took [mention training duration or number of epochs].
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Achieved an accuracy of [X]% on the validation set.
  - Loss value: [Include if relevant].
